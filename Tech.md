In the vertex, tessellation evaluation and geometry languages, a single global instance of the gl_PerVertex named block is available and its gl_Position member is an output that receives the homogeneous vertex position. It may be written at any time during shader execution. The value written to gl_Position will be used by primitive assembly, clipping, culling and other fixed functionality operations, if present, that operate on primitives after vertex processing has occurred.
